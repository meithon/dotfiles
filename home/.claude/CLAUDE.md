# Global Claude Assistant Instructions

## Development Guidelines

### YAGNI (You Aren't Gonna Need It)
- When writing code, implement only what is currently needed
- Avoid adding features or abstractions for potential future use
- Keep implementations simple and focused on immediate requirements

## Research and Investigation

### Tools to Use
- **context7**: Use for contextual research and analysis
- **deepresearch**: Use for comprehensive investigation
- **ghq get**: Use to clone repositories for source code reference
  - Example: `ghq get owner/repo` then reference the local clone

### Output Format
- Always format research results in Markdown
- Include clear headings and structured information
- Provide code examples and references where applicable

## Code Reference Standards
- Clone repositories locally using `ghq get` instead of browsing online
- Reference actual source code from local clones
- Provide file paths and line numbers when relevant
